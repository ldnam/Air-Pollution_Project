In recent years, air pollution has become increasingly serious in various
cities worldwide, including Valencia. Consequently, accurately predicting
the level of pollution plays a crucial role in finding effective solutions to combat this issue. This research paper focuses on utilizing
the LSTM model to forecast concentrations of two main pollutants
(specifically NO2 and PM10) and examining the opinions of Valencia
residents on a new solution for air pollution through a short survey. The LSTM model proves to be efficient in predicting pollutant
levels and identifying areas at risk of excessive pollution, and the
survey highlights that residents have a moderate level of satisfaction
with the current air quality and express significant support for the
proposed air sensor solution. The findings underscore the importance
of addressing air quality challenges by implementing measures such
as expanding green spaces and enhancing urban traffic management.
